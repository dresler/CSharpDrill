            // 1. Modify the "Main" method to make it wait for any key to be pressed before exiting
            // Search web for answers if you don't know how to do this. 
            // Hint: you only need to write one line of code.

        //Task2
            // 1. Print "Hello World" to the console
            // 2. Call this method from the "Main" method so that you can run the application and check that it works

        //Task3
            // 1. Initialise class DateTimeFun in the "Main" method and invoke its only public method
            // 2. Run the program to test your code.         

        //Task4
            // 1. Solve all tasks described in class DateTimeFun
            // Use what you did in Task3 to test your code
    }
